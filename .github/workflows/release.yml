    steps:
      # many of semantic-release's actions require access to github api.  for
      # example, the @semantic-release/git plugin needs to commit to the release
      # (master) branch without requiring code reviews.  this is not possible
      # with the GITHUB_TOKEN from the Github Actions (default) app that is
      # automatically available in workflows.
      #
      # one way to do this is to use a personal access token (pat).  this really
      # rubs me the wrong way, as it is dependent upon a single user account.
      # this would likely create a mess later down the line.
      #
      # instead, we've created a github app in our org called "CSM GH Bot", and
      # we're going to impersonate that app.
      #
      # currently, this bot is installed independently on one repo at a time,
      # and its secrets are individually set in each repos secrets.
